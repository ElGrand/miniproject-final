Final Version of mini project 3

# Q: What type of Regression have you applied?
A: I have applied a Linear, Multiple Linear and a Polynomial Regression

# Q: Which were the Challenges?
A: The Challenges were mostly with the Multiple Linear Regression, as it was the hardest to figure out the R2-score.

# Q: How accurate is your solution
A: The most accurate I could get was with the Multiple Linear Regression. I got the R2-score to 0.68. The lowest R2-score I got was on Linear Regression with an R2-score of 0.49. And on Polunomial regression the R2-score was 0.55 as the highest.

# Q: What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?
A: I could use Data Cleaning the Polynomial Regression to ensure the dataset is free from missing values and outliers.
I could do Residual Analysis to examin the residuals to identify patterns or areas where the model may be performing porrly. Adjust the model accordingly.
If possible, i would collect more data to increase the size of the dataset, so I can have more accurate models.
